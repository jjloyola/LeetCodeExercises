      <h1>LeetCode - Remove Element</h1>
      <p>
        Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences
        of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then
        return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k,
        to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain
          the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of
          nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
        </li>
        <li>Return k.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Custom Judge:</h2>
      <p>The judge will test your solution with the following code:</p>
      <pre>
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
      </pre>
      <p>If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.</p>

      <h2>Example 1:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Input:</b> nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3<br />
        <b>Output:</b> 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]<br />
        <b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 2, with the first
        two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond
        the returned k (hence they are underscores).
      </p>

      <h2>Example 2:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Input:</b> nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2<br />
        <b>Output:</b> 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]<br />
        <b>Explanation:</b> Your function should return k = 5, with the first
        five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4. Note that the five
        elements can be returned in any order. It does not matter what you leave
        beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
      </p>

      <h2>Constraints:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>0 <= nums.length <= 100</li>
        <li>0 <= nums[i] <= 50</li>
        <li>0 <= val <= 100</li>
      </ul>
